# Go Example: Hello World with Proto.Actor

## Introduction
This simple Go example demonstrates a basic "Hello World" scenario using the Proto.Actor framework. It's a straightforward introduction to actor-based programming in Go.

## Description
The program defines a `hello` message struct and a `helloActor` actor type. The actor receives a `hello` message and logs a greeting to the console. This example is designed to be an entry point for understanding how actors receive and process messages in Proto.Actor.

## Setup
Ensure the following are installed to run this example:
- Go programming environment
- Proto.Actor for Go

To install Proto.Actor, use the command:
```bash
go get -u github.com/asynkron/protoactor-go
```

## Running the Example
1. Save the code in a file, named `main.go`, for example.
2. Execute the program with:
```bash
go run main.go
```

## Additional Notes
- The `helloActor` struct implements the `Receive` method, which is triggered upon message arrival.
- The `main` function creates an actor system, spawns a `helloActor`, and sends it a `hello` message.
- This example is a great starting point for those new to the Proto.Actor framework and actor-based systems in Go.

This example provides a basic yet illustrative demonstration of using actors in Go with the Proto.Actor framework.
